### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
- Research C# and .NET
- Create a Front end using C#
- Ensure the page is semi-functional at this point
- Create a backend using .NET
- Connect the backend to the front end to ensure the data is properly rendering.
- Enable CRUD functionality with the backend
- Basic styling 
- Ensuring Responsiveness

#### PostMVP 

- Advanced Styling and details.
- Added details for filtering
- Animation effects
- Research into incorperating additional Libraries with C#
