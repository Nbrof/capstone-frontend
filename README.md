## API

Use this section to include info about the API you have chosen and a code snippet of the data that it returns and is required for your project. 


```
Link to API page: https://xkcd.vercel.app/?comic=303

{Comictest {
	
	
alt: "Others include \"We've incrementally improved the estimate of this coefficient,\" \"Maybe all these categories are wrong,\" and \"We found a way to make student volunteers worse at tasks.\""

## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Also, define the the React components and the architectural design of your app.

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
- Find and use external api 
- Render data on page 
- Render the latest XKDC comic to the page
- Allow user to interact with a button to grab a random comic
- Basic styling 
- Ensuring Responsiveness

#### PostMVP 

- Allow user to input some numbers to select a comic
- Advanced Styling and details.
- Additional Comic snippets
- Animation effects
- Research into incorperating additional Libraries.

## Components
##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| App | This will make the initial data pull and include React Router| 
| Header | This will render the header include the nav | 
| Comic | This will render the comic that is pulled from the API| 
| Infobox | This will render information, Including proper copyright information|
| Footer | This will render the header include the nav | 
| Quotebox | A responsive component that briefly talks about XKDC's creator. |

## Additional Libraries
 Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project such as Axios, ReactStrap, D3, etc.

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description.  Code snippet should not be greater than 10 lines of code. 

```
  const getComic = async () => {
      const url = `https://xkcd.vercel.app/?comic=${getRandomInt(comicStart.num)}`
      const response = await fetch(url);
      const Data = await response.json()
        setComic(Data)
      }
```


## Issues and Resolutions
 Use this section to list of all major issues encountered and their resolution.

#### 

**ERROR**: API Information not being received                 
**RESOLUTION**: CORS Error, Swapped to seperate API that had the same information.

**ERROR**: App would not deploy on a live site                    
**RESOLUTION**: Continuous Integration error, Added CI=False to NPM Build.

**ERROR**: Text would not properly render in Quotebox component
