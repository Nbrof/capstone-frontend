                number however over the years has skyrocketed to the modern number of 3368 of active sattelites. All together there have been nearly eleven thousand total launches.</h4>

                <h6>That is an impressivley large number, One that pales to comparission to the tens of thousands of new estimated launches with the development
                    of orbital constellations and cost reduction thanks to manufacturing changes, size reduction, and launch improvements. This website is dedicated to helping stay up to date with the amount of
                    sattelites that are presently in orbit. A very special thanks to the Union of Concerned scientists for the data they have that helped form this website
